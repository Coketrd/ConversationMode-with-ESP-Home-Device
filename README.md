# NoWakeWord_DoAConversation
Do a Conversation with youre HomeAssistant-Assist without needing a WakeWord the hole time.

First of all, I would like to tell you about my setup. It may be that this also works with other systems, but I have the following setup:

- An ESP32 with an INMP441 microphone
- HomeAssitant software
- Extended OpenAI Conversation Integration
- Alexa Media Player Integration
- The Home Assistant Cloud
- Amazon Echo Dot for playback

What is the procedure?

The ESP32 records the audio, which is converted into text and sent to chatGPT for answering. This then sends back its answer in the form of text. The text is then spoken in an mp3 file with the selected voice from the cloud and stored locally on the system. This link is tapped, saved in a helper and the media file is temporarily copied via a pyscript, opened and the length of the mp3 file is read out. Depending on how long the MP3 file is, additional seconds are added and stored in a timer.

As soon as the link changes (which happens with every new request), the pyscript is started via an automation and waits for the timer to expire. As soon as the timer has expired, listening is reactivated by the ESP.

What needs to be created?

1. For this purpose, an additional switch for immediate listening must be integrated into the ESP, which simultaneously deactivates the wakeword during this time. 
This is the code for the ESP. I use an ESP32 NodeMCU Module WLAN WiFi Dev Kit C Development Board with CP2102

2. We need to create a helper in which we save the URL.
   i Useing an Input Text Helper:   input_text.url_esp32_voice_assist

3. We need to create a script to save the URL in the helper

```
alias: ha_voice_alexa_url
sequence:
  - target:
      entity_id: input_text.url_esp32_voice_assist
    data:
      value: "{{ url }}"
    action: input_text.set_value
mode: single
description: ""
```
4. Now you need to install the integration pyscript from HACS https://github.com/custom-components/pyscript and set:
   - Allow all imports? YES.
   - Use Home Assistant as a global variable?Use Home Assistant as a global variable? YES
